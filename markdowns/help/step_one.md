Implementation Process: Downloading Large Files via Proxy
#### 1. Preparation Stage

- **Objective Definition:**
    - Download a specified large file (e.g., with a known URL).
    - Ensure HTTP requests are sent through a SOCKS5 proxy.
- **Resource Preparation:**
    - Obtain a SOCKS5 proxy list (e.g., from a file, API, or online service, including IP addresses and ports).
    - Prepare a download tool or environment (a client supporting HTTP and SOCKS5 proxies).
    - Determine the target file’s URL and expected download path.


#### 2. Proxy Selection Process

- Step 1: **Initialize Proxy List**
    - Load the SOCKS5 proxy list, recording each proxy’s IP address and port number.
- Step 2: **Test Proxy Availability**
    - Test each proxy in the list one by one:
        - Configure the client to use the current proxy.
        - Send a simple HTTP request (e.g., access a small test URL like “http://example.com”).
        - Check the response:
            - If it returns successfully with a 200 status code, mark the proxy as “valid.”
            - If it times out or fails (e.g., connection refused), mark it as “invalid.”
    - Filter out all valid proxies and discard invalid ones.
- Step 3: **Test Proxy Speed**
    - Test the speed of valid proxies:
        - Use each valid proxy to download a small test file (e.g., 1MB in size).
        - Record the download completion time and calculate the download speed (MB/s).
    - Sort by speed and retain the top N fastest proxies (N set based on needs, e.g., 3).


#### 3. Download Preparation

- **Select Proxy:**
    - Choose the top-ranked proxy (optimal proxy) from the filtered list of fast proxies.
- **Configure Download Environment:**
    - Set the HTTP client to use the selected SOCKS5 proxy (IP and port).
    - Specify the target file’s URL.
    - Configure download parameters:
        - Support resumable downloads (if the file is large).
        - Set up segmented downloads (optional, e.g., split the file into multiple parts for parallel downloading).
        - Define a timeout period (e.g., 30 seconds).


#### 4. Download Execution Process

- Step 1: **Initiate Download Request**
    - Send an HTTP download request to the target URL via the selected SOCKS5 proxy.
    - If segmented downloading is supported, use the Range header to specify the download range.
- Step 2: **Monitor Download Status**
    - Track download progress in real-time (downloaded bytes/total bytes).
    - Check download speed and connection status:
        - If the speed falls below a preset threshold (e.g., 100KB/s) or times out, mark it as “proxy failure.”
        - If the download is interrupted, record the breakpoint position.
- Step 3: *Handle Exceptions*
    - If the proxy fails or the download is interrupted:
        - Select the next proxy from the fast proxy list.
        - Update the client’s proxy configuration.
        - Resume downloading from the breakpoint position (using the Range header).
    - Repeat this step until the download succeeds or the proxy list is exhausted.


#### 5. Download Completion and Verification

- Step 1: **File Integrity Check**
    - After the download completes, verify that the file size matches the expected size.
    - If the file has a checksum (e.g., MD5 or SHA256), calculate and compare it.
- Step 2: **Process Results**
    - If verification passes, save the file to the specified path and mark the task as complete.
    - If verification fails, log the error and attempt to redownload using another proxy.


#### 6. Optimization and Logging

- **Optimize Proxy List:**
    - Update the proxy list’s status based on this download’s performance (e.g., mark failed proxies or prioritize fast ones).
- **Log Recording:**
    - Record details such as the proxy used, download duration, speed, and number of interruptions.
    - Save logs for subsequent analysis and improvement.


#### Notes

- **Proxy Stability:** Prioritize proxies with a history of stable performance to avoid frequent switching.
- **Concurrent Testing:** During proxy selection, test multiple proxies in parallel to save time.
- **Network Conditions:** Account for local network bandwidth affecting download speed to ensure fair testing.
- **Security:** Ensure the target URL and proxy sources are reliable to avoid downloading malicious files or using unsafe proxies.
